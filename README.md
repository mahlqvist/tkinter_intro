# Intro to tkinter

This is just a simple app to understand the fundamentals of [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

In order to use Python when building graphical user interfaces, import the **tkinter** package. 

**Tk** or *Tool Kit* is a GUI toolkit for developing desktop applications and Tk is the standard GUI for **Tcl** or *Tool Command Language*, which is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.

Python cannot access *Tcl/Tk services* directly, so it must use a intermediary like tkinter, which allows you to use python syntax when accessing tcl/tk services, and tkinter makes everything appears as an object.

**Tkinter** is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit and the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
